# Setting Up a Multi-VM Network with Internal Connectivity Using Vagrant and VirtualBox

## Project Overview:

In this project, youâ€™ll configure multiple virtual machines (VMs) using Vagrant and VirtualBox, establish internal connectivity, and enable communication between them using a private network. This setup is ideal for simulating distributed systems, multi-tier applications, or isolated environments.

---

## Prerequisites:
Before starting, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

1. **Sufficient Host Machine Resources: At least 8 GB of RAM and multiple CPU cores to support multiple VMs.**

---

## Step-by-Step Implementation:

### Step 1 - Initialize the Project

- Organize the project files in a dedicated folder:

```
mkdir multi-vm
cd multi-vm 
```

- Generate a default `Vagrantfile`:

```
vagrant init
```

should look like this:

### Step 2 - Configure the Vagrantfile

- Open the `Vagrantfile` in your preferred text editor:

```
nano Vagrantfile
```

Or:

```
code Vagrantfile
```

- Replace the default content with the following configuration:

```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # VM 1: Application Server
  config.vm.define "app" do |app|
    app.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-22.04"
    app.vm.hostname = "app.local"
    app.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.10"
    app.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
      vb.memory = "1024"
      vb.cpus = 1
    end
  end

  # VM 2: Database Server
  config.vm.define "db" do |db|
    db.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-22.04"
    db.vm.hostname = "db.local"
    db.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.11"
    db.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
      vb.memory = "1024"
      vb.cpus = 1
    end
  end
end
```

**Key Configuration Highlights:**

**VM Definitions:**

- app: Acts as the application server.
- db: Serves as the database server.

**Private Network:** Each VM has a private IP for internal communication.

**Resources:** Allocates 1 GB of RAM and 1 CPU core per VM.

###Step 3 - Start the Virtual Machines

- Bring Up the VMs:

```
vagrant up
```

- Verify the VMs Are Running:

```
vagrant status
```

You should see both `app` and `db` VMs in the `running` state.

### Step 4 - Test Internal Connectivity

- SSH into the App VM:

```
vagrant ssh app
```

![alt text](image/vag%20ssh%20app.png)

- Ping the Database VM:

```
ping -c 4 192.168.56.11
```

You should see successful responses indicating internal connectivity.

- Exit the App VM:

```
exit
```

---

### Step 5 - Configure Services on Each VM

**App Server Configuration:**

- Access the App VM:

```
vagrant ssh app
```

- Install and Start Apache:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apache2
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
```

- Check Apache Status:

```
sudo systemctl status apache2 
```

- Exit the App VM:

```
exit
```

**Database Server Configuration:**

- Access the Database VM:

```
vagrant ssh db
```

- Install and Start MySQL:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mysql-server
sudo systemctl start mysql
sudo systemctl enable mysql
```

- Check MySQL Status:

```
sudo systemctl status mysql 
```

- Exit the Database VM:

```
exit
```

---

### Step 6 - Advanced Testing

**Test Apache from the Database VM:**

- SSH into the `db` VM:

```
vagrant ssh db
```

- Test access to the App Server:

```
curl 192.168.56.10
```

You should see the default Apache HTML page content.

something like this: 

![alt text](image/defualt%20apache%20html.png)

if youre familiar with HTML it shouldn't confuse you when you see it.

Exit the Database VM:

```
exit
```


**Test MySQL from the App VM:**

- SSH into the App VM:

```
vagrant ssh app
```


- From the `app` VM, test connectivity to the MySQL service on the `db` VM:

```
mysql -h 192.168.56.11 -u root
```

---

### Step 7 - Clean Up (Optional)

- Stop the VMs while preserving their state:

```
vagrant halt
```

- Remove the VMs completely:
```
vagrant destroy -f
```

---

# Conclusion

In this project, you:

- Configured multiple VMs with internal connectivity.

- Deployed and tested services on the Application and Database servers.

- Established communication between the VMs using a private network.

This setup demonstrates the foundation for building complex, multi-tiered, and distributed systems in a virtualized environment.
